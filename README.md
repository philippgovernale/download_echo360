## FAQ

### How do I retrieve the Course URL for a course?

You should go to the main Echo360 Lecture page, which usually composed of all the lecturer recordings in a list format as shown below. It's the main page that lists all the recorded lectures and gives you the option to stream them or download them individually. This is important for downloading all the available videos from within the course.

## Technical details

The current script uses a web-driver to emulate as a web-browser in order to retrieve the original streaming link. There are current option for the web-driver: Chrome. It then uses a hls downloader to simultaneously download all the smaller parts of the videos, and combined into one. Transcoding into mp4 will be performed if ffmpeg is present in your system, and all files will be renamed into a nice format.
